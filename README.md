# Sentiment-Analysis

The aim of this project is to perform a Twitter sentiment analysis i.e. mining Tweets through live streaming data using Twitter API modulus and prepare a report on determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. The approach is to collect data from live twitter feeds on topics related to public opinions about products, services, brands, politics, or any topic that people can express opinions about. This data can be very useful for commercial applications like marketing analysis, public relations, product reviews, net promoter scoring, product feedback, and customer service. The project would use Python, Twitter API for data extraction and regex for data cleaning. Twitter provides
a streaming API to stream real time twitter data. This library named Twitter is available in python to access Streaming API and download twitter data. The filter on this data is
based on a list of keywords supplied.
